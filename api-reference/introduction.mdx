  If you need additional API endpoints then reach out to us.
</Note>

## Welcome

Production Url: https://prod.oneloop.ai

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens in the `Authorization` HTTP header in the following format.

```
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
```

If you are using one of the SDKs, then you can set the authorization header as such

<CodeGroup>

```typescript typescript
import oneloop from '@api/oneloop';

oneloop.auth('TOKEN');
```

</CodeGroup>

The API Token can be generated in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.oneloop.ai)
