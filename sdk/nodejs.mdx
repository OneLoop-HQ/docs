This documentation is around adding authentication to your APIs written in javascript or typescript. Our NodeJS sdk is written natively in typescript and can be used in any nodeJS project.

If you are using javascript then you can use this same sdk but typescript types will not be available.

[Link to NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oneloop-hq/oneloop-ts)

## Installation

Let's get started by installing the package

```bash bash
npm i @oneloop-hq/oneloop-ts@latest
```

## Initialize the SDK

To start using Oneloop in your project, you need to initialize the sdk with your Oneloop SDK Key. You can find this key in your [Oneloop Dashboard](https://dashboard.oneloop.ai/sdk-keys-manager)

```typescript
import { OneloopClient } from "@oneloop-hq/oneloop-ts";

const oneloop = new OneloopClient({
  token: process.env.ONELOOP_SDK_KEY ?? "",
});
```

## Using Oneloop SDK

There are many features available in Oneloop. But the most important one is verifying API keys. This is the point where you get a request from your user with an API key in the authorization header.

### Verify API Keys

With Oneloop, verifying API Key is just one line of code. With this verification, you get to know whether the api key is valid or not. If not valid, why not valid? And any metadata you have associated with the api key, like customer id, usage limit, etc.

```typescript
const verifyKey = await oneloop.verification({
  key: "CUSTOMER_API_KEY",
  requestedScopes: [],
});

console.log("API Key status: ", verifyKey.status);
```

### Check for permissions

Many times you would want to verify if a api key has permission to access a specific resource. For example, you want to allow users to access a specific endpoint but not another.

You can do this by passing the requested scopes to the verification function. In this case, let's say you want to check if the api key is valid and has read permission `user`

```typescript
const verifyKey = await oneloop.verification({
  key: "CUSTOMER_API_KEY",
  requestedScopes: [
    {
      id: "user",
      representation: "user",
      read: true,
      create: false,
      update: false,
      del: false,
    },
  ],
});
```
