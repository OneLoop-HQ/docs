<Note>
  This SDK is for adding authentication to your NextJS routes. If you would like
  to add our embeddable frontend UI to your NextJS app, please refer to the
  [Oneloop UI SDK](/sdk/starter-kits/nextjs).
</Note>

Our NextJS SDK is a simple way to add authentication to your NextJS routes. We have also written an in-depth blog on how to add API Keys to your NextJS routes using Oneloop. You can read it [here](https://www.oneloop.ai/blog/how-to-add-api-keys-to-nextjs-routes).

## Installation

```bash bash
npm i @oneloop-hq/nextjs@latest
```

## Adding Authentication

Adding Oneloop auth to your NextJS routes is as simple as adding the `useOneloop` higher order function to your route handler.
This function takes in two arguments: the route handler and an object with the `sdkKey` property set to your Oneloop SDK key.

This function will automatically verify the user's API key and return a 401 if the key is invalid. To override this behavior, you can pass in a custom error handlers as the third argument as shown here

<Warning>
  Please make sure **not to expose your Oneloop SDK key** in your frontend code.
  Always add your SDK key to your server components or environment variables.
</Warning>

```typescript api/profile/route.ts
"use server";
import { withOneloop } from "@oneloop-hq/nextjs";

export const GET = useOneloop(
  async (request: Request) => {
    return new Response("Profile Endpoint Authenticated");
  },
  { sdkKey: "<YOUR_ONELOOP_SDK_KEY>" }
);
```

## Validating with scopes

At Oneloop, we call RBAC / Permissions as Scopes. You can easily add scopes to your route by passing in the `scopes` property to the `useOneloop` function.

Scopes takes in an array of objects with the `representation` and optional `read`, `create`, `update`, and `del` properties.

So to check if the key has _read_ and _create_ access attached to _profile_ scope, we can modify our code as below

```typescript api/profile/route.ts
export const GET = useOneloop(
  async (request: Request) => {
    return new Response("Profile Endpoint Authenticated");
  },
  {
    sdkKey: "<YOUR_ONELOOP_SDK_KEY>",
    scopes: [
      {
        representation: "profile",
        read: true,
        create: true,
      },
    ],
  }
);
```

## Handling Errors

You can also pass in a custom handlers as the third argument to the `useOneloop` function for handling errors and invalid keys.
There are 2 types of handlers you can pass in: `onError` and `onInvalidKey`.

### `onInvalidKey()`

This function will be called if the user's API key is invalid, rate limited, reached usage limit, or does not have the required scopes

```typescript api/profile/route.ts
export const GET = useOneloop(
  async (request: Request) => {
    return new Response("Profile Endpoint Authenticated");
  },
  { sdkKey: "<YOUR_ONELOOP_SDK_KEY>" },
  {
    onInvalidKey: async (request, error) => {
      return new Response("Invalid Key: " + err.message, { status: err.code });
    },
  }
);
```

### `onError()`

This function will be called if there is an error while verifying the user's API key. Possible scenario can be if you passed in the wrong Oneloop SDK Key

```typescript api/profile/route.ts
export const GET = useOneloop(
  async (request: Request) => {
    return new Response("Profile Endpoint Authenticated");
  },
  { sdkKey: "<YOUR_ONELOOP_SDK_KEY>" },
  {
    onError: async (request, error) => {
      return new Response("Error while verifying API key", { status: 500 });
    },
  }
);
```
