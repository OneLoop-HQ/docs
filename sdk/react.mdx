To get you easily started with providing all functionality around API Key management, we have created a React SDK that you can use in your React application.

With a single line of code, you can add a component that will handle the entire API Key management process for you.

### Backend - Get Link Token

In your backend, set up a POST request to initialize a Oneloop session and get a `link_token` from <a href="/api-reference/endpoints/retrieve-a-workspace">Link Token</a> endpoint

<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
curl 'https://prod.oneloop.ai/api/v1/link-token' 
  -H 'authorization: Bearer <your_oneloop_sdk_key>' 
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' 
  -H 'content-type: application/json' 
  --data-raw '{ 
    "workspaceId":"workspaceId", 
    "customerId":"customerId" 
  }'
```

```javascript node
fetch("https://prod.oneloop.ai/api/v1/link-token", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    authorization: "Bearer <your_oneloop_sdk_key>",
    accept: "application/json, text/plain, */*",
    "content-type": "application/json",
  },
  body: {
    workspaceId: "workspaceId",
    customerId: "customerId",
  },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

Pass in your Production Access API key as a header.

### Set up a React application using Vite

Scaffold your new React application using <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project">Vite</a>

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm create vite@latest oneloop-react --template react-ts
cd oneloop-react
npm install
npm run dev
```

</CodeGroup>

### Install the React SDK

Oneloop's <a>React SDK</a> gives you access to prebuilt components, hooks, and helpers for React.

To get started using Oneloop with React, add the SDK to your project:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @oneloop-hq/frontend-react-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

### Embed Oneloop API Key Manager

Now make the same request in your frontend to get the `link_token` and initialize the Oneloop session.

Feel free to pass `workspaceId` and `customerId` from your frontend. Or you can have them hardcoded in your backend.

<Warning>
  Please make sure **not to expose your Oneloop SDK key** in your frontend code.
</Warning>

```javascript ApiSettingsPage.tsx
import { OneloopApiKeyManager } from "@oneloop-hq/frontend-react-sdk";
import { useState } from "react";

const WORKSPACE_ID = "<your-oneloop-workspace-id>";
const CURRENT_CUSTOMER_ID = "<your-customer-id>";

export default function Page() {
  const [linkToken, setLinkToken] = useState<string>("ADD_GENERATED_LINK_TOKEN");

  return (
    <div>
      {linkToken &&
        <OneloopApiKeyManager
          accentColor="#ADFF85"
          description="Create a key that unlocks full API access, enabling extensive interaction with your account. Learn more"
          textColor="#000000"
          title="Standard keys"
          token={linkToken}
          darkMode={false}
        />
    </div>
  );
}
```
