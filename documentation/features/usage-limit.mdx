title: Usage Tracking

Usage limits is applicable per api key. For custom needs, reach out to us.

## What is usage limits?

Usage-limits limit the number of time an api key can be used successfully.

Each successful verification decrements the usage limit on the key.

Once the key reaches 0, then you will receive `USAGE_LIMITED` status in your verification call.

## Refills

You can refill the usage limit using the refill api method

## Subscription billing

You can also track usage for customers based on their API keys. Check the [Verify Key API](/api-reference/endpoints/verify-a-key-for-a-given-workspace) for more information on how to pass in usage. There is also an example of how to add usage and retrieve usage for a key in the [Express Starter Kit](/sdk/starter-kits/express#retrieving-usage).
