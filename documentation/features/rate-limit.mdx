Rate limiting is applicable on the workspace level currently. For custom needs, reach out to us.

## What is rate-limiting?

Rate-limiting is a mechanism used to control the number of requests that can be made to a server within a certain time period. It helps prevent abuse, protect server resources, and ensure fair usage. By implementing rate-limiting, developers can set limits on the number of requests that can be made by a client or user, preventing them from overwhelming the server with excessive requests. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where there is a need to protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, or maintain the overall performance and stability of the server.

## Enabling rate-limiting

Oneloop provides a built-in rate limiter. Rate limiting can be enabled on a Workspace, and then it applies to each key created under that workspace

## Disabling rate-limiting

Just turn it off on the Workspace and it is applies to all keys.
