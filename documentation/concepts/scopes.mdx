<Note>
    You must specify an unique id when creating a scope. You can then reference this id when verifying API keys using the SDKs
</Note>

## Adding Scopes to Workspace

You can use the dashboard or SDK to create scopes. 

When using the SDK you can create scopes and reference them in real time.

## Considerations

- Scopes are associated with a Workspace.
- Scopes are free-form, meaning you can create a scope name `panda` without any meaning
- Scopes created on a workspace are then available to be added to an API key created under that workspace
