title: SDK Keys
---

<Note>
    SDK Keys are keys that you use to integrate with our systems. They are not customer facing.
</Note>

Following are considerations:

1. SDK Keys can only be generated using our Dashboard.
2. You can assign different scopes to your SDK Keys for the right authorization level.
3. You should store SDK keys securely in your backend.
4. SDK Keys are not publishable keys, they are secret keys that must not be exposed to the public
5. In the event of exposure, revoke them immediately in the dashboard.
