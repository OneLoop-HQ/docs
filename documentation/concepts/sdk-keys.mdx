title: SDK Keys
---

<Info>
  SDK Keys are keys that you use to integrate with our systems. They are not
  customer facing.
</Info>

<Warning>SDK Keys are secrets. Do not expose them.</Warning>

SDK Keys are used to authenticate your application with our systems. SDK Keys are not customer facing and should be stored securely in your backend.

The concept of workspace does not apply to SDK Keys. SDK Keys are global and can be used across all workspaces.

## Generating SDK Keys

SDK Keys can only be generated using the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.oneloop.ai).

## SDK Key Scopes

You can associate scopes with the SDK Key to ensure more security.

### Definitions

When you create a SDK Key you can configure the following scopes

| Scope Name         | Description                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `workspace`        | Access to workspace resources |
| `workspace_scopes` | Access to workspace scopes    |
| `api_keys`         | Access to API keys            |

Based on the scope, the SDK key can access certain functionality.

For example, a SDK Key without the `api_keys` write scope, can not create API keys on the fly.

## Considerations

Following are some considerations:

- [x] SDK Keys can only be generated using our Dashboard.
- [x] You can assign different scopes to your SDK Keys for the right authorization level.
- [x] You should store SDK keys securely in your backend.
- [x] SDK Keys are not publishable keys, they are secret keys that must not be exposed to the public
- [x] In the event of exposure, revoke them immediately in the dashboard.
