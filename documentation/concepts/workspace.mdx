A workspace refers to a project. It is a logical separation for your API Keys. For example, you can have a workspace for your test environment and another for your production environment.

## Create a Workspace

There are 2 ways to create a workspace:

### 1. Using the dashboard

To create a workspace, you can go to the dashboard and click on the `Create Workspace` button.

### 2. Using the API

You can also create a workspace using the API. Here is an example of how you can create a workspace using the [Create Workspace API](/api-reference/endpoints/create-a-workspace):

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://prod.oneloop.ai/api/v1/workspace \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "<string>"
}'
```

## Workspace Settings

Once you have created a workspace, you can configure the settings for the workspace in the dashboard. Here are some of the settings you can configure:

- [x] You can define scopes in your workspace. Learn more about [scopes](/documentation/concepts/scopes).
- [x] You can issue API keys for your workspace. Learn more about [API keys](/documentation/concepts/api-keys).
- [x] You can set rate limits for your workspace. Learn more about [rate limiting](/documentation/concepts/rate-limiting).

## Workspace ID

Each workspace has a unique ID. This ID is used to identify the workspace in the API. You can find the workspace ID in the dashboard.
